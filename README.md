# Data Science Salary Estimator: Project Overview 
* Created a tool that estimates data science salaries (MAE ~ $ 11K) to help data scientists negotiate their income when they get a job.
* Scraped over 1000 job descriptions from glassdoor using python and selenium.
* Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, tableau, tensorflow, pytorch, excel, aws, and spark. 
* Optimized Linear, Lasso, Xgboost, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.
